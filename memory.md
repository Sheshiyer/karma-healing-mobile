# KLEAR KARMA PROJECT MEMORY

## Overview
Klear Karma is a community-verified healing platform connecting seekers with practitioners. The website showcases trust verification, AI matching, practitioner spotlights, and mobile apps. Recent refactoring removed scientific validation references to focus on holistic community-driven healing.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Add Interactive Hover States to All Cards
**Outcome**: Successfully implemented enhanced hover effects across all card components throughout the application, replacing basic hover-lift with sophisticated multi-layered animations.

**Breakthroughs**:
- Created five new hover effect classes: `hover-lift`, `hover-glow`, `hover-reveal`, `hover-scale`, and `hover-border-glow`
- Implemented group hover patterns for coordinated element animations within cards
- Added chakra-themed color transitions and scaling effects
- Created staggered animation delays for progressive reveal effects

**Fixed Errors**:
- Replaced basic hover-lift effects with contextually appropriate hover states
- Enhanced user feedback through visual cues and smooth transitions
- Improved accessibility through clear interactive states

**Code Changes**:
- Added enhanced hover effect styles in `src/index.css` (lines 255-320)
- Updated all card components in `src/pages/Index.tsx` with appropriate hover classes
- Applied group hover patterns to Trust Verification, Community Stories, AI Matching, Practitioner Spotlight, Revenue Impact, and Global Impact sections
- Enhanced progress bars, statistics, and content elements with hover-responsive animations

### ✅ Replace Random Animated Dots with Meaningful Chakra Energy Flow
**Outcome**: Successfully transformed random floating particles into structured chakra energy systems across the hero section and global impact visualization.

**Breakthroughs**:
- Created three new animation keyframes: `chakraFlow`, `energyPulse`, and `spiralFlow` for authentic energy movement
- Implemented structured chakra energy centers with proper color coding and positioning
- Added flowing energy particles and spiral energy flows with staggered animation delays
- Replaced random impact points with meaningful "Global Healing Network Connections"

**Fixed Errors**:
- Eliminated random positioning that didn't align with chakra philosophy
- Removed meaningless animated dots that provided no spiritual context

**Code Changes**:
- Added new CSS animations in `src/index.css` (lines 200-250)
- Updated hero section in `src/pages/Index.tsx` with structured chakra energy system
- Updated global impact section with healing network connections
- Enhanced visual foundation enables better hover interactions and micro-animations

## [2024-12-19] Task Completed: Replace random animated dots with meaningful chakra energy flow
- **Outcome**: Successfully replaced random floating particles with structured chakra energy flow patterns
- **Breakthrough**: Created three distinct energy systems - main chakra centers, flowing energy particles, and spiral flows
- **Errors Fixed**: Removed meaningless random positioning in favor of intentional chakra-based positioning
- **Code Changes**: 
  - Added new CSS animations: `chakraFlow`, `energyPulse`, `spiralFlow`
  - Added CSS classes: `.animate-chakra-flow`, `.animate-energy-pulse`, `.animate-spiral-flow`, `.chakra-particle`
  - Updated hero section with 7 main chakra energy centers positioned vertically
  - Added 12 flowing energy particles cycling through chakra colors
  - Added 6 spiral energy flows for dynamic movement
  - Updated Global Impact section with 6 major healing centers representing continents
  - Added energy connections and healing ripples between global centers
- **Next Dependencies**: Enhanced visual foundation enables better hover interactions and micro-animations
